For project two our team developed a purchase request and inventory tracking system called Trax. Trax allows entities to create, review and approve purchase requests as well as track and update their existing inventory. The application will include user authentication to assign different access levels to users (Initiator, Reviewer, Admin, etc.). Email notification functionality will also be present through the utilization of React.js.

**The requirements for Project #2 were as follows:**

  * Must use a Node and Express Web Server
  * Must be backed by a MySQL Database with a Sequelize ORM  
  * Must have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
  * Must be deployed using Heroku (with Data)

  * Must have a polished frontend / UI
  * Must have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm
  * Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)
